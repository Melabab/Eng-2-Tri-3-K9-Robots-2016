Code back up

*<INSTRUCTIONS>*
• Install Android Studio (if not already installed)
• Download the most recent "ftc_app-master" from this repository: https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app
• Open the ftc_app-master with Android Studio
• In the "project" part of Android Studio, go to FtcRobotController > java > opmodes
• Control click on the opmodes folder. Go to "new", then click "java class"
• Title the class TeleOp1Cont, or TeleOp2Cont based on which class you are copying and pasting.
• Delete EVERYTHING ON THE PAGE! EVERYTHING!
• Paste EVERYTHING THAT IS ON GITHUB IN IT'S PLACE!
• Open the robot controller phone and UNINSTALL THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF FTC ROBOT CONTROLLER!
• Plug the robot controller phone in. Make sure the phone says it is plugged in as a "MEDIA DEVICE". Wait for android manager to install. You will not need to use this tool, it just installs automatically.
• Click the "run" button on top of Android Studio (looks like a play button)
• Wait for the code to run. When a prompt appears asking which phone you select to run it on, select the only option. 4.4.4
• Let the code run. When completed, the app will open on the phone. It is then safe to unplug.
• Plug the phone into the robot. Configure it so the first DC motor is named: "rightDC" and the second is named "leftDC". Configure the servo controller so the first servo is named "arm" and the second is named "hand".

The code should work after that. Mr. Lai or Mr. Dengler can answer questions.
